Our first call is free and it is about getting to know each other.  It is an introduction call and takes normally half an hour. We would discuss the situation you are in, what motivates you and the goals that you have.

There is no obligation afterwards to continue working together. If we then decide to continue, we can also figure out how we best work together.
