Our first call is free and it is about getting to know each other.  

The first call is an introduction call and takes normally half an hour. 

There is no obligation afterwards to continue working together.

We would discuss the situation you are in, what motivates you and the goals that you have. 

If we then decide to continue, we can also figure out how we best work together.
