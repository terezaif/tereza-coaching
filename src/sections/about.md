I’ve spent almost two decades in data – starting in hands-on roles and eventually leading and building data teams. Along the way, I’ve learned that leadership isn’t about a fancy title. It’s about knowing your strengths, communicating clearly, and empowering others to grow. Plus – knowing how to add and show the value you create!


<br>

I’ve worked with companies like XING, Free Now and neuefische, building data products and growing data talent. Now, I help people in data step into leadership roles with clarity and confidence, so they can make a real impact without feeling stuck or overlooked.

If you’re ready to grow your influence and take the next step in your career, I’m here to help.
